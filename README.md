# README

This site was built for a good friend of mine who really likes the singer, JoJo. He knew I had just started to learn how to code so he asked if I could build him a fun site with a theme of her. I originally built it when I had just learned HTML, Javascript, and CSS. After learning React I decided to transfer it over and I am wanting to add in a madlibs game as well as a magic 8 ball. 

You can visit the demo of the project here: [JoJo](https://nataliejuner.github.io/demos/jojo/)
